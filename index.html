          <p class="card-text">Recent studies show that only 24% of Millennials demonstrate basic financial literacy skills[1]. If your financial and personal aspirations for your kids aim higher than this, it’s time to begin focusing on financial literacy and teaching your kids about money.

            There’s a lot to learn before entering the real world, including spending, savings, banking, earning, borrowing, giving, and much more – but it’s never too late! We have all the tools and resources you need, all organized in an easy, step-by-step guide to financial literacy for kids  from 3-18.</p>

              <h1>1. Teach your kids independence and responsibility through chores</h1>
              <p>Household tasks played an important role in teaching my kids independence and responsibility even though completing chores wasn’t linked to their allowance.

                My kids were responsible for making their bed, keeping their bedroom clean, setting the dinner table, and putting their laundry away at the end of the night. Chores teach kids what it is to work hard and the value that comes from it. Doing household tasks helps your kids understand what it takes to make money.
                
                While they often grumbled about the work, they later shared their thanks for giving them the skills necessary to live on their own.</p>

                <h1>2. Open a saving account for your child and take them through the process</h1>
              <p>What better way to help kids financial literacy than to have them manage their own money? I gave my kids an allowance starting at age five. I committed to paying it weekly through college as long as they invested half of it into their personal savings accounts.

                By showing your children how you open their accounts, how to make deposits, and how to track their savings, you can impart valuable financial literacy for kids.
                
                Parents can make a household rule that savings stay untouched until it affords its owner a valuable opportunity. Savings includes money from allowance and other income including gifts. In turn, your kids will one day be amazed at the doors that their savings will open for them.</p>

                <h1>3. Educate your children about finance concepts</h1>
              <p>Every day at the Women’s Business Development Council, I witness the women empowerment that education offers. Simply put, knowledge is power, and it will give your children the opportunity to make choices and follow dreams. So show your kids that learning about money is an important part of them having a successful future.

                Put education at the top of your parenting priorities by setting expectations and celebrating educational success. Children learn by example and observation.
                
                Set up a college savings account as soon as possible, as this is part of financial literacy for children. Research scholarships and take advantage of low-cost after-school enrichment and tutoring programs. And involve your children in the process, as it will allow them to build their financial confidence.</p>

                <h1>4. Leverage fun resources to impart financial literacy for kids</h1>
              <p>As you’re teaching your children financial literacy, make the experience fun. Leverage fun activities, games, and money books for kids.

                Create weekly money dates or have weekly standing money conversations. You can even have them pursue some great business ideas for kids!
                
                The whole idea is to make talking about and dealing with money a comfortable experience for your children. Need ideas? Check out our free course on teaching your kids healthy money habits. And here are some financial literacy games for kids.</p>
